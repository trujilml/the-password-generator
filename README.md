# Password Generator Starter Code
## Application Purpose
This is a password generator that generates strong, secure, and unique passwords as selected by specific requests from the user. When the "Generate Password" is clicked, the user is welcomed with a series of prompts on the criteria they want for the password. Character length is answered first, with the character range of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. This is soon followed by the character type prompts (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, single-digit numbers, and/or special characters) which are confirmed by the user. With the length and at least one character type specified, the user input is validated and prints out the user's generated password on the page.
